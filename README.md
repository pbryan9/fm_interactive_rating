## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Didn't really break any new ground on this one - more Vite/React/Styled-components practice. I did get to use CSS custom properties a little more than I had done in the past, so that's a little bit of growth there.
